MockMe is a Cross Framework Mock Object Framework for PHP5, currently released as an
alpha version for interested developers to assist in offering feedback. It is
not yet fully functional, and stability is a relative term :).

Requirements:

PHP: 5.2.4, probably less but I haven't checked
Extensions: ext/runkit

Note: Do not install runkit from PECL since the current release does not support
PHP 5.2. Follow the installation instructions below to grab a patched version of
runkit which supports both PHP 5.2 and static methods. Windows users should download
the DLL from the given link - a patched version of the DLL will be made available
soon. If you have installed from PECL delete the module and follow the instructions
below to replace it with a slightly improved patched version.

Installation (Manual Installation without PEAR):

1. Copy the contents of /library to a location on the PHP include_path, e.g.
   /usr/share/php.

2. Install the runkit extension but NOT from PECL. Windows users can grab the DLL
   from http://dev.phpspec.org/php_runkit.dll but should disable E_STRICT error
   reporting (I will compile a patched DLL for use with MutateMe soon). Linux users
   should compile runkit from source. I've put up a patched version supporting
   static methods (via a David Sklar patch) and PHP 5.2 (from CVS HEAD in PECL)
   at http://github.com/padraic/runkit

   Use the following commands to compile from source (install git first!):

   git clone git://github.com/padraic/runkit.git runkit
   cd runkit
   phpize
   ./configure
   make
   make install

   Finally, enable the extension in the php.ini file which is loaded for the cli
   environment using:

   extension=runkit.so

   Check the output of "php -i" or phpinfo() to ensure the extension is loaded.

Usage:

MockMe defines two functions called mockme() and mockme_verify() which are a shorter
means to call MockMe::mock() and MockMe::verify() which are both static methods. A simple
use case is as follows:
